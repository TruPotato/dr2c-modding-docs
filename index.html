        <h2>Hello!</h2><br>
        <p>Welcome to the (unofficial) Death Road to Canada modding documentation! By the time you're reading this, hopefully a modding update will have come out, making this site entirely obselete. <br><br>However, in the event that that hasn't happened, you've come to the right place! <br><br>Below is a list of links with examples of each and every command currently available to modders, as well as descriptions of what each file in deathforth does, and so on. I will also add quickstart guides for custom special characters, weapons, cars, etc, whenever I get around to learning that stuff.</p><br>
